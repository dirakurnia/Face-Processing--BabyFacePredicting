# Face-Processing--BabyFacePredicting
A Project for Academic Purpose to create an Image Processing Program.
Inside this program, all comments and notes were given in Bahasa. The reason why this project title were chosen was
in these days, few teenagers (some friends) usually be curious how their baby will look like. With this Face Processing Program, this program will help
teenagers insert their close-up picture also with their couple (or dream couple), then this program will be going through a theory to find the level of
similarities between the couple and babies (candidates) to find the best baby picture that fits or in the maximum level of similarities.

**Picture Requirements**
- A Close-Up Picture which has a pixel size of 500x500
- Saved inside the IDE's working directory
- To make it collective, try to put all the sample (man, woman, baby) inside one storage or folder
  and of course the storage itself needs to be saved inside the IDE's working directory
  
**haarcascade_frontalface_default**
is the module file / library for Face Detecting Purposes. Make sure to put it and save the file path
for programming needs.
